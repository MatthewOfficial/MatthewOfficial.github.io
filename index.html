      </dt>
      <dd style="text-align: left;">I like to gather information on a variety of
        subjects. I have experience in a variety of programming languages such
        as JavaScript, Python3, Swift, Ruby, C/C#/C++ , BASIC, Lua, 4Lang, and
        GDScript, and I am enthusiastic to learn more. Here is an example of my
        "Hello World!x5" program in Python3:</dd>
    </dl>
    <blockquote>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><code></code><code>for x in range (0, 5):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print("Hello World!")<br>
          input()</code></div>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">The output is predictably,</div>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><code>Hello World!</code></div>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><code>Hello World!</code></div>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><code>Hello World!</code></div>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><code>Hello World!</code></div>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><code>Hello World!</code></div>

        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diligence</h3>
      </dt>
      <dd>I put in work the work needed to accomplish things. Cross country and
        track are great examples of this where I have run hundreds of miles over
        vacations, not to mention practice every day including some weekends.
        This is combined with schoolwork during the day, however, I still make
        time to work on any number of side projects. Currently I spend spare
        time on a Unity game with a small team.</dd>

        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adaptiveness</h3>
      </dt>
      <dd>I do work in a variety of fields. I am on the cross country and track
        teams, familiar with game engines like Godot and Unity 3D, and do
        chemistry as a hobby, all along with my programming experience. I strive
        to be on the cutting edge of technology, such as with programming
        languages like Ruby and Python3 and new developments like CRISPR, self
        driving cars, Falcon Heavy, and the Librem 5.</dd>

        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patience</h3>
      </dt>
      <dd>I have been described as a patient person. This is extremely important
        with programming, as problems often require slow and thorough analysis
        to fix. My patience has been strengthened by my extensive future
        planning, which required prolonged thought as to what to do and how to
        do it. I have taken a variety of classes which are often the hardest
        classes available to me, and am able to finish the work to get good
        grades in all of them.</dd>

        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Team Affinity</h3>
      </dt>
      <dd>I work effectively in teams. I am currently in a small group working
        on a Unity game, and have been managing collaboration and file
        synchronization for the team. After everyone has become more comfortable
        with the collaboration will move to a new task such as game animation.</dd>
